Mathematics is about logic and reasoned arguments and the only way to present a reasoned and logical argument is by writing about it clearly. Your writing may include numbers and other mathematical symbols, but they are not enough on their own. You should copy the writing style used in good mathematical textbooks, such as those recommended for your modules. **You can expect to lose marks for poor writing (incorrect grammar and spelling) as well as for poor mathematics (incorrect or unclear logic).**\n",

    "Longest increasing subsequences appear in many areas across mathematics, computer science, and physics.\n",
    "This project will deal with algorithms for creating longest increasing subsequences of permutations of a set of $n$ numbers, their graphical representation, and some analysis of their structure with computational and graphical means.\n",
    "\n",
    "As Python indexing starts with zero, we will also start counting at zero and hence give the mathematical description in terms of the set of numbers $[n]=\\{0,1,\\ldots,n-1\\}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a given $n\\in\\mathbb N$, let $\\pi=(\\pi_0,\\pi_1,\\ldots,\\pi_{n-1})$ be a **permutation** of $[n]$, i.e., one of the $n!$ possible orderings of $[n]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sequence  $(\\pi_{i_0},\\pi_{i_1},\\ldots,\\pi_{i_{k-1}})$ is a **subsequence** of the permutation $\\pi$ if $0\\leq i_0<i_1<\\ldots<i_k<n$. \n",

    "---\n",
    "## Answer 1.1\n",
    "* For the function to run as expected, the argument `pi` should be an iterable such that is subscriptable in an appropiate format. For instance arrays, strings, tuples or dictionaries in a sensitive format could be accepted and return the expected output. For instance, suppose we have $n\\in\\mathbb N$, and $\\pi=(\\pi_0,\\pi_1,\\ldots,\\pi_{n-1})$ where $\\pi$ is a permutation of $[n]$\n",
    "    - A string in the form: `pi` = \"$\\pi_0\\pi_1...\\pi_{n-1}$\" would return the expected output.\n",
    "    - A list in the form: `pi` = [$\\pi_0, \\pi_1, ..., \\pi_{n-1}$] would return the expected output.\n",
    "    - A tuple in the form: `pi` = ($\\pi_0, \\pi_1, ..., \\pi_{n-1}$) would return the expected output.\n",
    "    - A dictionary in the form: `pi` = {0: $\\pi_0$, 1: $\\pi_1$, ..., n-1: $\\pi_{n-1}$} would return the expected output. \n",
    "    - Any other non-subscriptable iterable such as a set or any other data type that is not an iterable such as an integer will raise a Type Error. Any of these data types listed above in a different format will most likely give an unexpected output. Other subscriptable data types would need to be examined independently.\n",
    "* The data type returned will always be an integer greater than or equal to 0. This is because the return value will be the return value of the max() function that receives a non-empty list of integers bigger than or equal to 0 (assuming that the `pi` input is of appropiate data type and format). The function returns the max value of `l` or 0 if it is empty (`l` has only non-negative integers).\n",
    "* Each ith element of `l` maps to the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence from $\\pi_0$ to $\\pi_i$ containing $\\pi_i$. For intance, if we have the sequence `pi` = [4, 5, 3, 8, 1, 9, 7, 2, 6], we will have `l[0]` = 1 as the longest strictly increasing subsequence of $(4)$ is $(4)$ of length 1. `l[1]` = 2 as the longest subsequence is $(4, 5)$ but `l[2]` = 1 as the longest strictly increasing subsequence of $(4, 5, 3)$ is still $(4, 5)$, but the longest of these subsequences containing $3$ is just $(3)$.\n",
    "* The outer loop goes through each entry in pi and the inner loop goes through each entry from 0 to the current ith entry of pi. The conditional with `pi[j]<pi[i]` and `l[j]>l[i]` in the inner loop, will compare each of the previous terms with the new ith entry and check if the new entry is greater than each of them. For each time the new entry is greater than a previous term, then it will check which increasing subsequence of smaller, previous terms is bigger, and it will associate the new ith term to that subsequence. When the inner loop finishes executing, the length of the subsequence associated to the ith term will increase by one (as it was only counting the length of the subsequence up to the previous, smaller terms, and it needs to address the new term).\n",
    "* `max(l+[0])` and not `max(l)` because if pi is empty, for instance if `pi` = [], then it will still be a permutation of $[0]$. By definition, the empty set can only be ordered one way, but as it has no subsequences, then the longest subsequence is of length 0. However, if it weren't `max(l+[0])` and it was just `max([])`, the input `pi` = []  would give a ValueError but the input is an expected input (as the permutation of [0] exists). This problem is easily solved with `max(l+[0])` and it will not change the output when $n>0$ as the shortest strictly increasing subsequence will be of length at least 1. This is due to the fact that if  $n>0$, then `pi` contains at least a term and one of the increasing subsequences would be this term $\\pi_l$. \n",
    "* If we associate each lowercase letter to a number, in such a way that it coincides with their position in the English Alphabet, then the output of `find_length_of_longest_increasing_subsequence(\"computer\")` is correct. It considers the length of one of the longest subsequence (like `\"cmpr\"`) and returns its length (`4`). If, however, we consider that the output of `\"ComPUTer\"` should be the same, then the code doesn't return the same as `\"computer\"`, and so the code should be modified. If we also consider non-English characters such as `\"ñ\"` the code won't work as expected for some inputs. If we restrict the input to English lower case characters, then the code works as expected for this input (such as the `\"computer\"`). However if we are expecting for an error to be raised, because we are not considering lowercase strings as types of permutation, then the output is not correct. For this reason, depending in the situation, the output for `\"computer\"` could be correct or incorrect depending on the context where the code is needed. \n",

    "            l[i]=l[j]\n",
    "    </code></pre>\n",
    "    This has run time complexity of O($1$). Firstly because accessing a list in python from its ith element is constant. This is due to the fact that, for instance `pi[j]`, is a pointer that directly accesses the location of its element in memory. Comparing elements is obviously also independent of input size.\n",
    "    Now if we add:\n",
    "    <pre><code>\n",

    "        for j in range(i):\n",

    "    </code></pre> \n",
    "    \n",
    "    The first loop is directly proportional to the size of the input $n$. It increases linearly, as an input of size $n$ would entail $n$ iterations, an input of size $n+1$ would entail $n+1$ iterations and so on. (Remember that $n$ directly references the size of the input as `n = len(pi)`). However, as we have a for loop inside the outer loop, then an input of size $n$ would entail that for each of the $n$ iterations, say iteration $i$, there would be $i-1$ iterations. Hence the run time of the loops would be proportional to $n\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}{i}+(n-1)\\sum_{i=1}^{n-2}{i}+...+1+0$. Furthermore, $deg(n\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}{i}+(n-1)\\sum_{i=1}^{n-2}{i}+...+1+0) = 2$ and so the run time increases proportionally to this polynomial of $n$ which has $\\lambda n^2$ as the leading coefficient and where $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$. As the $n^2$ term makes the other negligible in big O notation, then this algorithm has O($n^2$). (I got help from this source https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation when deciding what happened with the leftover $\\lambda$).\n",
    "\n",
    "    On the other hand, the \"worst case\" and \"best case\" scenarios have the same run time complexity. This is because the number of iterations don't depend on the content of the input, but just the length of it. For instance if the sequence is $(0,1,2,3,4,5,...,n)$ or the sequence is $(n, n-1, ..., 2,1,0)$, even if the max length is trivial for both cases, the input will run the same amount of times for both of these cases. It will also run the same amount of times if the input is in total disarray but still of size $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For the rest of the code, as `len` over python built-ins has run time of O($1$), `max` has run time of O($n$) and `l=n*[0]` has run time of O($n$) and so these run times become negligible when compared with the code of run time O($n^2$). (Source: https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity)\n",
    " \n",
    "The space complexity of this code is of O($n$). \n",
    "* Reasoning: The only auxiliary memory being used is for `l` and for `n`. `l` has exactly the length $n$, so it uses the same memory space as the input and `n` uses constant memory space as it is just saving the length of the input. Hence the space used is linearly proportional to the input.\n",
