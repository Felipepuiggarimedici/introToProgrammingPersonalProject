Mathematics is about logic and reasoned arguments and the only way to present a reasoned and logical argument is by writing about it clearly. Your writing may include numbers and other mathematical symbols, but they are not enough on their own. You should copy the writing style used in good mathematical textbooks, such as those recommended for your modules. **You can expect to lose marks for poor writing (incorrect grammar and spelling) as well as for poor mathematics (incorrect or unclear logic).**\n",

    "---\n",
    "## Answer 1.1\n",
    "* For the function to run as expected, the argument `pi` should be an iterable such that is subscriptable in an appropiate format. For instance arrays, strings, tuples or dictionaries in a sensitive format could be accepted and return the expected output. For instance, suppose we have $n\\in\\mathbb N$, and $\\pi=(\\pi_0,\\pi_1,\\ldots,\\pi_{n-1})$ where $\\pi$ is a permutation of $[n]$\n",
    "    - A string in the form: `pi` = \"$\\pi_0\\pi_1...\\pi_{n-1}$\" would return the expected output.\n",
    "    - A list in the form: `pi` = [$\\pi_0, \\pi_1, ..., \\pi_{n-1}$] would return the expected output.\n",
    "    - A tuple in the form: `pi` = ($\\pi_0, \\pi_1, ..., \\pi_{n-1}$) would return the expected output.\n",
    "    - A dictionary in the form: `pi` = {0: $\\pi_0$, 1: $\\pi_1$, ..., n-1: $\\pi_{n-1}$} would return the expected output. \n",
    "    - Any other non-subscriptable iterable such as a set or any other data type that is not an iterable such as an integer will raise a Type Error. Any of these data types listed above in a different format will most likely give an unexpected output. Other subscriptable data types would need to be examined independently.\n",
    "* The data type returned will always be an integer greater than or equal to 0. This is because the return value will be the return value of the max() function that receives a non-empty list of integers bigger than or equal to 0 (assuming that the `pi` input is of appropiate data type and format). The function returns the max value of `l` or 0 if it is empty (`l` has only non-negative integers).\n",
    "* Each ith element of `l` maps to the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence from $\\pi_0$ to $\\pi_i$ containing $\\pi_i$. For intance, if we have the sequence `pi` = [4, 5, 3, 8, 1, 9, 7, 2, 6], we will have `l[0]` = 1 as the longest strictly increasing subsequence of $(4)$ is $(4)$ of length 1. `l[1]` = 2 as the longest subsequence is $(4, 5)$ but `l[2]` = 1 as the longest strictly increasing subsequence of $(4, 5, 3)$ is still $(4, 5)$, but the longest of these subsequences containing $3$ is just $(3)$. The function returns the maximum of these values (assuming `pi` is not empty) as the longest possible increasing subsequence will have as end-element one value in $\\pi$ with index $m, 1\\leq m \\leq n$, for which length will be the same as the value in `l[m]`\n",
    "* The outer loop goes through each entry in pi and the inner loop goes through each entry from 0 to the current ith entry of pi. The conditional with `pi[j]<pi[i]` and `l[j]>l[i]` in the inner loop, will compare each of the previous terms with the new ith entry and check if the new entry is greater than each of them. For each time the new entry is greater than a previous term, then it will check which increasing subsequence of smaller, previous terms is bigger, and it will associate the new ith term to that subsequence. When the inner loop finishes executing, the length of the subsequence associated to the ith term will increase by one (as it was only counting the length of the subsequence up to the previous, smaller terms, and it needs to address the new term).\n",
    "* `max(l+[0])` and not `max(l)` because if pi is empty, for instance if `pi` = [], then it will still be a permutation of $[0]$. By definition, the empty set can only be ordered one way, but as it has no subsequences, then the longest subsequence is of length 0. However, if it weren't `max(l+[0])` and it was just `max([])`, the input `pi` = []  would give a ValueError but the input is an expected input (as the permutation of [0] exists). This problem is easily solved with `max(l+[0])` and it will not change the output when $n>0$ as the shortest strictly increasing subsequence will be of length at least 1. This is due to the fact that if  $n>0$, then `pi` contains at least a term and one of the increasing subsequences would be this term $\\pi_l$. \n",
    "* If we associate each lowercase letter to a number, in such a way that it coincides with their position in the English Alphabet, then the output of `find_length_of_longest_increasing_subsequence(\"computer\")` is correct. It considers the length of one of the longest subsequence (like `\"cmpr\"`) and returns its length (`4`). If, however, we consider that the output of `\"ComPUTer\"` should be the same, then the code doesn't return the same as `\"computer\"`, and so the code should be modified. If we also consider non-English characters such as `\"ñ\"` the code won't work as expected for some inputs. If we restrict the input to English lower case characters, then the code works as expected for this input (such as the `\"computer\"`). However if we are expecting for an error to be raised, because we are not considering lowercase strings as types of permutation, then the output is not correct. For this reason, depending in the situation, the output for `\"computer\"` could be correct or incorrect depending on the context where the code is needed. \n",

(Remember that $n$ directly references the size of the input as `n = len(pi)`). However, as we have a for loop inside the outer loop, then an input of size $n$ would entail that for each of the $n$ iterations, say iteration $i$, there would be $i-1$ iterations. Hence the run time of the loops would be proportional to $n\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}{i}+(n-1)\\sum_{i=1}^{n-2}{i}+...+1+0$. Furthermore, $deg(n\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}{i}+(n-1)\\sum_{i=1}^{n-2}{i}+...+1+0) = 2$ and so the run time increases proportionally to this polynomial of $n$ which has $\\lambda n^2$ as the leading coefficient and where $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$. As the $n^2$ term makes the other negligible in big O notation, then this algorithm has O($n^2$).

    "## Answer\n",
    "Provided that `pi` does not have length 0 (is not empty), then recursion will be used to compute the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence. The recursive function being called inside `find_length_of_longest_increasing_subsequence_alternative` is `aux`, which will return a list `l`, with the same properties as the list `l` in the original non-recursive function. \n",
    "### How does recursion work in aux\n",
    "* The base case of `aux` is given when the length of its input, `psi` is equal to 0. When this happens it will return an empty list. `aux` calls itself $n$ times.\n",
    "* The recursive call will call another lambda function, which in turn will call the `aux` function again with a shortened version of the `pi` input containing all its elements except the last one. This will happen repeatedly, calling the lambda function over itself, taking as input the output of `aux` with a shortened version of `pi`. \n",
    "    - If, for instance, the original `pi` variable has length $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, and suppose we call $f$ the lambda function inside `aux`, then the following will happen inside the first `aux` call: $f \\circ f \\circ f... \\circ f([])$ where f calls itself $n - 1$ times. However, as it calls itself repeatedly, the pi value that $f$ uses is different. In the first (outermost) call, $f$ uses the complete version of `pi` as `psi`, `psi` shortened by one element, and so on. The last call uses a version of `psi` with only one element (its first element).\n",
    "    - $f$ in turn will return a list `l` of length 1 at first, but will be updated each time $f$ calls itself. This is due to the fact that $f$ is updating the list it is recieving as input, adding one element to it, and then returning it. This element each $f$ is adding corresponds to the length of the longest increasing subsequence that contains the last added element of `pi`. The explanation of how it does this is omitted here as it doesn't use recursion, but it uses python functions such as `enumerate` and `max` as well as list comprehensions.\n",
    "    - The final $f$ will return the full list `l` with $n$ entries.\n",
    "* `aux` will return the last `l` list returned by the othermost $f$ function call. In summary, suppose `pi` = [ $\\pi_0, \\pi_1, ..., \\pi_{n-1}$], then:\n",
    "    - `aux`(`pi`) = $f \\circ f \\circ ... \\circ f$`(aux([])` = $f \\circ f \\circ ... \\circ f$`([])` where f is called $n-1$ times and refers to the lambda function inside `aux`. The ith call of $f$ will use `psi` = [ $\\pi_0, \\pi_1, ..., \\pi_{i}$] instead of `pi`."
